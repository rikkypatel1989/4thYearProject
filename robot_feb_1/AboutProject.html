<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>Technology and mobile robots continue to see a rapid growth and  have helped the society at an advanced level. Moreover, technological advances  have given us the capabilities to connect and control most network based  objects through the internet. The constant development of internet based  application has eased the development of various wireless devices. In the near  future, network based devices will see a larger role in controlling various  wireless and internet based devices. </p>
<p>Our group has a keen interest in this project because of the  improved steps that the robotic industry has taken. In addition to that,  robotic industry has revolutionized various aspects in fields such as military  and commercial. The project was also chosen in order to successfully  demonstrate the knowledge acquired in various fields of programming and  automation control system.</p>
<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>A  Robot is an electromechanical device that is capable of making decision and  function on its own in order to accomplish the given task [1]. Research in  mobile robots has seen a steady growth in the last few years which has led to  the everyday utilization in fields such as military, entertainment and  manufacturing industry. The wireless mode of connection allows users to  interact with several functions and features that a mobile robot provides. With  the increasing demand of mobile robots, their applications are expanding as  well. Automatic self-motion is necessary for the robot as it adds more to the  work that a robot can do. The autonomous guided robots with the modern mobile  platform are very much capable of operating in areas without requiring initial  investment of the surrounding [2]. There are various types of robot navigations  currently in use such as manual remote, autonomously guided, and Tele-robotics.  These robots are being used in different fields like medical, surgical and high-risk  places. They have the potential to assist doctors in surgical procedures. They  are used in reaching the dangerous places or inaccessible areas where human  approach is not possible. There is a need of development of robotics for  military application, shoreline exploration of mines and repairing ship  structure [2]. <br>
  <br>
  Internet mobile robots are very  beneficial for emergency services; they can play an important role in assisting  police officers and firefighters. For example, a flying robot can get to the  place where human cannot reach. It can help in identifying thieves using the High  Definition camera attached and can collect information about the incident such  as time, place and snapshots of the incident. Afterwards, the mobile robot saves  the data through internet. Therefore, the snapshots collected can help in  identifying eyewitness and criminal(s). In case of fire, the flying objects can  fly at a high altitude and help the firefighters in finding the fire victims in  distress and estimate the danger level.<br>On the other hand, a robotic boat can  be sent to explore undiscovered places that are out of reach for humans. Using  the internet via wireless control, the robotic boat can send images of the surrounding  area and can also send data such as temperature, atmospheric pressure,  existence of other objects and location. All the collected data information can  be securely saved on a virtualized cloud computing platform.  </p>
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop the capability to control  network-based objects, such as a robot via the internet using network based  application. In this project, we are developing a network application that will  connect to the robot that we build and will be able to control it through the  internet. We are rebuilding a mobile robot that is a boat which was built by  previous students. We will reconstruct the boat and add new features to it.  &nbsp;Once the boat is built with complete features and start to function  properly, we will build a web interface with Network based protocols to control  the mobile boat through the internet. The objective of this project is to  eliminate the presence of a human operator onboard and to use software to  control the boat from a remote location.</p>
<h3>Problem Statement: </h3>
<p>The main problem for the  mobile robot is to control the device wirelessly through the web. In terms of  hardware, the issue would be calibration, connection and proper function of the  sensors and motors. For software, we would need to build a stable web  interface, connect to the microcontroller and control the robot wirelessly.</p>
<h3>Technical Overview:</h3>
<p>The mobile  robot will be designed and developed with capability to be controlled  wirelessly, using wireless router and be able to control the movement through  any internet capable device. The project has two parts, building a functional  robot and developing a user interface on the web. </p>
